This is not published on the Chrome extensions store, you can download it and run it as and "unpacked extension" or you can download a CRX file on the [releases page](https://github.com/jmhobbs/jira-external-links/releases) and then go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and drag the CRX over that page to install it.
